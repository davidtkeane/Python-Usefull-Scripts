# The code above is a simple code that creates a yellow heart using the turtle module in Python. 
# The code creates a turtle object and sets the shape size to 0.2, 0.2. 
# The screen background color is set to black, and the turtle fill color is set to yellow. 
# The turtle then begins filling the shape and draws the heart using the forward and circle functions. 
# The heart is then filled with the yellow color, and the turtle.done() function is called to keep the window open. 
# The code creates a simple yellow heart shape using the turtle module in Python. (Clcoding.com, 2021)
