Here's a detailed guide on how to install and use I2P+ on a MacBook, alongside installing and using I2PSnark:

Installing I2P+ on MacBook
Step 1: Install Java
I2P+ requires Java to run. Download and install Java from Oracle or use Homebrew for an easier installation:
Using Homebrew: Open Terminal and run:
bash
brew install --cask temurin
This installs Eclipse Temurin (OpenJDK-based Java) which is compatible with I2P+.

Step 2: Download I2P+
Visit the I2P+ GitHub page or the official site at i2pplus.github.io.
Download the latest release for macOS. This might be a .jar file or an installer specific for macOS.

Step 3: Install I2P+
With .jar File:
Open Terminal, navigate to where you downloaded the .jar file, and run:
bash
java -jar i2pinstall_*.jar
Follow the installation wizard. Choose installation options like the directory where I2P+ will be installed.
With macOS Bundle (if available):
Double-click the .dmg file to open it, then drag the I2P+ application icon to your Applications folder.

Step 4: Run I2P+
Launch I2P+ from the Applications folder.
After a few minutes, when I2P+ establishes connections, open your browser to http://127.0.0.1:7657/ to access the router console.

Step 5: Configuration
Adjust settings in the router console for bandwidth, security, and other preferences. Ensure your router is fully integrated into the I2P network for optimal performance.

Installing and Using I2PSnark
Step 1: Access I2PSnark
I2PSnark should be included with I2P+. Access it by navigating to:
http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2psnark/ in your browser if using the integrated version.

Step 2: For Standalone I2PSnark (from I2P+)
If you prefer a standalone version:
Download the standalone I2PSnark from I2P+'s resources or GitHub releases.
Extract the downloaded files to a directory of your choice.
Run java -jar i2psnark.jar from Terminal in that directory.

Step 3: Using I2PSnark

Adding Torrents:
Click on "Add Torrent" in the I2PSnark interface.
You can either upload a .torrent file from your computer or enter an I2P URL for a torrent.
Managing Torrents:
Start/Stop: Use buttons to control torrent downloads.
Settings: Click the gear icon or go to settings to:
Change the download directory (i2psnark.dir in i2psnark.config file if editing manually).
Adjust bandwidth settings.
Configure I2CP settings if using standalone (see i2psnark.config for manual settings).
Creating Torrents:
If you want to share files, you can create a torrent via I2PSnark. Use the "Create Torrent" feature, choose your files, set a tracker like http://tracker.postman.i2p/announce, and generate the torrent.
Monitoring:
Keep track of download progress, speed, and peer connections through the I2PSnark interface.

Step 4: Troubleshooting
Permissions: Ensure you have write permissions in the directories where I2PSnark will save files.
I2P Connection: If I2PSnark isn't functioning, check if your I2P router is well-connected to the network.

Step 5: Security
Be wary of torrents from unknown sources to avoid malware or compromised files.

Additional Notes:
Updates: Check for updates within the I2P+ router console. I2P+ might have a different update mechanism than standard I2P, possibly involving manual file replacements or updates via torrent.
Privacy: Remember, I2P+ and I2PSnark are designed for privacy, but always be cautious with what you download or share.

This setup should get you running with I2P+ and I2PSnark on your MacBook, providing you with an anonymized way to share and download files within the I2P network.
