Setting Up I2P on MacBook Pro M3
Step 1: Install Java
Since I2P is written in Java, ensure you have a suitable Java runtime environment installed. Oracle's Java 8 is recommended:
Download Java from Oracle's website.
Double-click the installer and accept the license terms to install Java.


Step 2: Download and Install I2P
For macOS: 
Visit the I2P download page and download the macOS DMG bundle.
Open the .dmg file, drag the I2P application to your Applications folder to install it. This process mimics standard Mac application installation.


Step 3: Run I2P
Launch I2P from your Applications folder.
A browser window will open to the I2P Router Console, indicating successful installation. Here, you'll need to:
Wait for a few minutes for I2P to connect to peers and establish tunnels.
Complete the bandwidth setup wizard as prompted by the console.

Step 4: Configure Your Browser for I2P
To browse within I2P, you need to configure your web browser, preferably Firefox:
Go to Firefox's preferences, navigate to the Network Settings, and set up a manual proxy configuration with HTTP and SSL Proxy both pointing to 127.0.0.1:4444.
Alternatively, for easier switching between I2P and regular internet, consider using the FoxyProxy extension which works with Firefox and Chrome.



Hosting a Website on I2P (Eepsites)
Step 1: Prepare Your Content
Create the web content you want to host. This can be simple HTML files or a more complex website setup.

Step 2: Set Up Your Eepsite
In the I2P router console:
Navigate to the "Hidden Services Manager" (usually found under the "Configuration" tab).
Click on "Add" or "Create" to start setting up a new eepsite.
Choose a name for your eepsite (which will end in .i2p), and select or create a directory where your website files are stored.
Configure the eepsite settings like whether it's a standard or hidden service, and set up keys if you want to manage access.

Step 3: Configure Your Router for Hosting
Ensure your router is set up to handle hosting:
Go to the router console and check if your router is well-connected with enough peers for good performance.
Adjust bandwidth settings if necessary to share more or less of your internet connection.

Step 4: Start the Eepsite
After configuration, start your eepsite from the Hidden Services Manager. It will generate an .i2p address for your site.

Step 5: Access and Testing
Test your eepsite by accessing it through your configured browser. The address will be something like yourname.i2p. 
Ensure everything works as expected within the I2P network. Note that accessing from outside I2P is not possible unless you use outproxies, which are not common for eepsites.

Step 6: Security and Maintenance
Regularly check your I2P console for updates and security notifications.
Monitor your eepsite's performance and make adjustments in bandwidth or settings as needed.

Keep in mind that hosting on I2P provides anonymity but also comes with challenges like slower access speed due to the nature of the network. Your site will be accessible only to those with I2P installed and configured correctly. 

For further technical details or troubleshooting, refer to the I2P documentation or community forums. Remember, the visibility and performance of your eepsite depend heavily on the I2P network's health and your router's configuration.
